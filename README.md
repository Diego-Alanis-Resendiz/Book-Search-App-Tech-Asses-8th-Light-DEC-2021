# #1. ProjectDescription

> The application can perform two main fucntion. First it takes keywords from the user to display 5 search results provided by the Google Books API, and it allows you to create an ordered list of saved books within the same page. Initially, I attempted to use Node.Js and MongoDB to create this application. However, that was beyond the scope of what I needed to create. I decided to simplify the application down to an HTML webpage that utilizes Javascript logic to perform the necessary tasks. The web app will return an alert when the search entered is empty. The saved books are displayed at the bottom of the page even after an alert popups. The only unfortunate thing about this simplified approach is that if you reload the page, the list of saved books is cleared.

> Some of my biggest difficulties in creating this project dealt with applying my knowledge and using new technologies.
I hadn't had the chance to use the Google APIs yet, the first hurdle was attempting to properly access the information I wanted from Google Books.
The new simplified approach was easier to carry out but it did prove difficult to refactor. It was also difficult to think of a way to create a saved books list given that in vanilla js, anytime a reload the page my arrays are reset. In the future, I would like to attempt a new approach to local storage so that even when you reload the page all saved books do not dissappear
